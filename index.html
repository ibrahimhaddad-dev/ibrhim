        The dog (Canis familiaris when considered a distinct species or Canis
        lupus familiaris when considered a subspecies of the wolf)[5] is a
        domesticated carnivore of the family Canidae. It is part of the
        wolf-like canids,[6] and is the most widely abundant terrestrial
        carnivore.[7][8][9][10][11] The dog and the extant gray wolf are sister
        taxa[12][13][14] as modern wolves are not closely related to the wolves
        that were first domesticated,[13][14] which implies that the direct
        ancestor of the dog is extinct.[15] The dog was the first species to be
        domesticated,[14][16] and has been selectively bred over millennia for
        various behaviors, sensory capabilities, and physical attributes.[17]
        Their long association with humans has led dogs to be uniquely attuned
        to human behavior[18] and they are able to thrive on a starch-rich diet
        that would be inadequate for other canids.[19] Dogs vary widely in
        shape, size and colors.[20] They perform many roles for humans, such as
        hunting, herding, pulling loads, protection, assisting police and
        military, companionship and, more recently, aiding disabled people and
        therapeutic roles. This influence on human society has given them the
        sobriquet of "man's best friend".
